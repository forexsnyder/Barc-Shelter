              <li>• All BARC dogs must be kept on the leash at all times.</li>
              <li>
                • Please place your hand through the loop on the leash and keep
                our dogs on a short leash.
              </li>
              <li>
                • Keep both hands FREE of CELL PHONES, DRINKS, etc. when
                walking.
              </li>
              <li>
                • Do not let other people, children, or other dogs play with or
                pet our BARC dog.
              </li>
              <li>• Never take any BARC dog to a dog run.</li>
              <li>
                • Never take anything (bones, food, garbage, etc.) out of our
                dogs’ mouths. We will deal with // it when you bring the dog
                back to the shelter.
              </li>
              <li>
                • Do not try to “train” the dogs, as it will only confuse them.
              </li>
              <li>
                • Never tie up the BARC dog you are walking or leave them
                unattended for ANY reason.
              </li>
              <li>
                • If your dog is ever in a fight, never put your hands in to
                separate the dogs. Grab your dog’s hind legs, have the other
                person grab their dog’s hind legs, and pull them apart.
              </li>
              <li>
                • Always take some poop bags with you from near the front door.
                Picking up the poop makes us good neighbors and it is the law.
              </li>
              <li>
                • If a dog gets away from you, do not chase it! Squat or lie
                down and call the dog’s name and it should come back to you. If
                you chase them, they think it’s a game and will keep running
                away.
              </li>
              <li>
                • Take the dog for a 20-30 minute walk, or as directed. If your
                dog seems tired, come back
              </li>
              <li>
                • When your walk is finished, please bring your dog back to the
                kennel area for a staff member to put the dog away. Never go
                inside the kennel without a staff member.
              </li>
              <li>
                • If no one is in the kennel, ring the bell and someone will
                come to assist you.
              </li>
              <li>
                • Don't assume because the dog is small that it likes to be
                picked up.
